## This is a demonstration of work I did during "Embedded Systems - Based on AVR" diploma that I took with IMT_School.
### You can check [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/15_YGUiadvyy3ENnckCsbw-xwP8Stbxd2) to find:
1. Task Requirement PDF
2. `main.c` file (or maybe not, did not start keeping them until later)
3. A video of the hardware working (either in real life or simulated on `Proteus`)
4. Proteus File for simulated tasks (if exists --and maybe not, just my forgetful head again 😁😅)
#### Stay Tuned for the Final Project!
##### *Drivers exist in `DIO` folder and `FreeRTOS` folder.
